<p><a href="../../m2-genesis">Genesis</a> et <a href="../../m3-civitas">Civitas</a> is a top down god game using a dynamically generated world map. Players first take part in the creation of the world, influencing the effects of natural laws, before guiding civilisations and establishing themselves as their god.</p>

    <h3>
        
            Two Groups for One Project
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        <p><strong>A big idea for a big group</strong></p>
<p>The game has two phases. In the first section, “Genesis” players take part in the procedural generation of a world map. In the second part, “Civitas” players guide and influence the birth of civilisation. Both phases originate from the same idea: play god and watch your own world form. But with that idea at the core and 8 people on our hands, we decided to split the group into two fundamentally different parts of the game that build upon each other.</p>
<p><strong>Two different goals</strong></p>
<p>With this split, two different directives formed in each respective group. While Team Genesis is way more focussed on procedural generation and simulation of earth’s origin story, Civitas has a greater focus on gameplay aspects and AI simulation.</p>
<p>Still, both parts are intended to be played back to back and form a single two-part game.</p>
<p><strong>How are they connected?</strong></p>
<p>At the end of Genesis, when you have generated your own world, it is exported with all its parameters: A heightmap, temperature-maps, ground types, flora and fauna. At the beginning of Civitas, this world is imported and can be played on. This means that players shape their own playground in Genesis and can possibly create their dreamland for their soon-to-be civilisation in Civitas. Whether their civilisations thrive, depends on their player skill and previously created lands.</p>

    <h3>
        
            How did we work?
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        <p><strong>Two groups working as one</strong></p>
<p>For some aspects of the project, we worked separately from each other. While Genesis decided what parts of the world they worked on first, Civitas decided on the gameplay aspects and the population of the world. Both groups had individual weekly meetings, where goals, tasks and future ideas have been discussed.</p>
<p><strong>The challenge of organisation</strong></p>
<p>To bring the projects together, frequent communication was required. Additionally, to the weekly meetings, multiple flexible meetings were conducted between group leads, or sometimes multiple group members that specialised on certain aspects of gameplay or world generation.</p>
<p>Discussions involved different topics. World data and transfer of data was discussed extensively, to ensure all information and generated content was used in the gameplay. Progress reports were communicated in the form of writing, progress images and meetings between all group members. To guarantee a smooth workflow, all members needed an understanding of what each group is currently working on.</p>
<p><strong>Our favourite example</strong></p>
<p>A great example is the transference of world data to gameplay. While Genesis has used 2D arrays for their generation data, Civitas is utilising a hex-based grid with data containers for a better gameplay experience. Communicating changes in data usage, clarifying differences in map generation and explaining reasons for differing decisions between groups have been a priority to ensure functionality of gameplay and technical aspects.</p>
