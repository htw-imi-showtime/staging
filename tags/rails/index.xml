      <description>Overview If you have an event or project you want to share or invite people to, the current method is to elaborately and painstakingly hang posters throughout the campus. This problem has also plagued IDiA in the past. In collaboration with IDiA, our project aims to digitize this process by using old monitors and TVs as digital signage boards that can be placed throughout the campus to display information in real-time, enabling the university to repurpose its old hardware.</description>
