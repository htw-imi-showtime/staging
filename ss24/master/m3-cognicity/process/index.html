    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        As the very first step of our research, we read studies and articles on the topic of <strong>cognitive skills</strong> and how they can be tested to get an idea of what cognitive skills there are and how they could be measured. We also performed a <strong>market analysis</strong> to see what existing games with a similar focus are out there and what we could learn from them.
Simultaneously, we already collected ideas for <strong>possible minigames</strong> we could implement to help <strong>enhance specific cognitive skills</strong> and researched possibilities to <strong>motivate our users to keep training</strong>. To collect and review the results of our research in a single space, we gathered our findings in a miro board.
To finalize our research, we conducted an <strong>expert interview with a psychologist from Freie Universität Berlin</strong>. This way, we could ensure our solution will actually make sense from a <strong>psychological perspective</strong>. Basing our game suite on <strong>actual scientific findings</strong> is what differentiates our project from other similar games.

            Concept
        
    </h3>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        After we had done all the research and collected all the ideas, we started to work on the <strong>concept of our game suite</strong>. During this process, we looked at different possibilities on <strong>which tech stack</strong> we should use and for <strong>what platform</strong> we should build the project. Considering that the game suite <strong>should be available for everyone</strong> while making it as easy as possible for patients to get started, we decided on aiming for <strong>mobile devices</strong> like tablets and smartphones. Due to our previous experience with the engine, we ultimately decided to develop the game with the <strong>open-source Godot Engine</strong>.
During the concept phase we also picked which minigames we want to implement and started planning the game world and the overall design of the game using a <strong>mood board</strong> and <strong>user stories</strong>.
We divided the cognitive skills into <strong>five categories</strong> (Logical Thinking, Working Memory, Spatial Thinking, Attention and Reaction Speed) and decided that our <strong>minimum viable product</strong> should include at least one minigame for each category.

    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>While already developing the first minigames and setting up the backend, we started creating the designs. It was important to us that our game suite would be appealing for our <strong>target group</strong>: Adolescents and young adults between the ages of 13 and 30 who either suffer from chronic physical illnesses and spend a lot of time in hospital, or who are at risk of suffering cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we decided to go with a clean and simple design that feels <strong>warm and welcoming</strong>. We also wanted to make sure that the design is <strong>colorful and engaging</strong> to keep the users motivated to keep training. We also made sure to use a <strong>warm and friendly color palette</strong> to make the users feel welcome and comfortable.</p>

        After we had finished the concept and design phase, we started implementing the game suite. To coordinate and keep track of our work, we used the <strong>Kanban board</strong> we created right at the beginning of the project. This way, everyone could see what the others were working on and what still needed to be done. We also had <strong>regular meetings</strong> to discuss the progress and to help each other with problems we encountered.
