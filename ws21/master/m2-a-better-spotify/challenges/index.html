Therefore it was more than important to weigh out the possibilities of what was feasible and what the users actually wanted. In the end, the queue had a <strong>lower improvement rank</strong> than the <em>startpage, the usability, design and even the playlists themselves</em>.</p><figure><img src=/staging/ws21/master/m2-a-better-spotify/Priorities_new_alpha.png alt=Pirorities><figcaption>The finished Priority graph</figcaption></figure></div></section><section><h3>Starting at the first song</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content><p>A challenge that the team stumbled across in the later parts of development was certain issues with the Spotify API. Even though the API was a great help and managed to get the project where it is at this point, it still managed to put some stones into the team&rsquo;s path.</p><p>One of those was an issue with the liked songs and playing a certain one from the users&rsquo; list. Unlike in playlists, where a double click automatically plays the selected song, the liked songs always start with the first song in the list and then start their shuffle process.</p><p>This happened because in any other feature (Playlists, Albums, Singles, EP’s, Taglists etc) Better Spotify sends an offset to the API to indicate which song was selected so that the correct song would be played. For some reason though, this offset is not being accepted by the Spotify API when it comes to liked songs and this, unfortunately, stretches on to the search function as well.</p></div></section></main><footer><section><a href=https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/staging/ class=animate-trigger><strong>IMI<span class=light>⨯</span><span class=animate>ST</span></strong>
