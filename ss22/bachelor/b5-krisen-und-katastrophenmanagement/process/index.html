The app&rsquo;s goal is to provide a constantly learning and precautionary solution that allows rescue teams to react quickly and dynamically in case of emergencies while staying on top of things. Our team developed the prototype as a starting point for this ambitious endeavour.</div></section><section><h3>Research</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content>The <strong>development of a prototype</strong> that enables the implementation of the projects vision started with an <strong>extensive research phase</strong>.
After our first meetings with our supervisors we started to read into the topic and tried to get an overview of what the app is supposed to be, what it could look like and how we bring it to live. Because we had to start developing the application from scratch and with only the idea and some requirements, we started of a little rocky and had difficulties finding a real starting point. However, we knew that we needed to have some kind of <strong>visualization</strong> to get an idea of what we could do. Therefore, creating a click-through mock-up in Figma helped us getting started and <strong>conceptualize the prototype for hereiam</strong>.</div></section><section><h3>Project-planning</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content>Having a picture in mind of what we want to do we could finally <strong>start to plan, assign tasks and organize our team</strong>. Consequently, we decided on deviding into <strong>smaller teams</strong>. In the beginning, we had difficulties deciding on what software we wanted to use for different components of our application and tested various options until we agreed on an final approach. This trial phase clarified and highlighted the well-working processes that we then sticked with until the end. Furthermore, we decided on having <strong>a weekly meeting</strong> every tuesday as the whole team and with our supervisor to communicate our progress, difficulties and ideas as well as assinging new tasks.</div></section><section><h3>Development</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content>After getting started with the development process the picture of the application we had in mind started to <strong>become real and take shape</strong>. In our sub-teams we worked on the different components of our app, but when problems appeared we mostly <strong>worked together on finding solutions</strong>. The consistent weekly meetings helped us staying productive as a team and keeping track of what features were realistic to implement and which were not achievable within our time frame.</div></section></main><footer><section><a href=https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/staging/ class=animate-trigger><strong>IMI<span class=light>⨯</span><span class=animate>ST</span></strong>
