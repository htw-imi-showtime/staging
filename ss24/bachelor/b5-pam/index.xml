      <description>Process The Project was both a technologically tricky undertaking, and a means for us to learn how programming projects will work in the future, with a large focus on Agile Development and SCRUM-style Progress management. We started by setting up a regular Scrum Schedule. Sprints were undertaken on a bi-weekly basis, with remote progress meetings every second week between the sprints, regularly on Wednesdays. We started off by examining the original site, and taking a look at the programming language that had been chosen for us.</description>

      <description>Features Completely Updated Codebase The original PAM was written in Springboot/Vaadin. The new PAM is written in React/Typescript, with usage of Figma for the design amongst other tools. Of course, this meant re-working the Tool from the ground-up in order to get all the old features working, before adding new features down the line. *&#xA;New Design The original PAM was not as appealing to the eye as it could be.</description>
