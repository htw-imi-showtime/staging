      <description>UI In the initial stages of development, one key challenge our team faced was designing a user interface (UI) that effectively accommodates the input of constraints and preferences from teachers. Creating a user-friendly and simple UI for teachers to specify their requirements posed a significant hurdle, as it required striking a balance between complexity and user-friendliness. We undertook extensive brainstorming sessions ensuring that it could efficiently capture the nuanced constraints and preferences without overwhelming the teacher.</description>

      <description>Features Keyword extraction:
Moodle Course: By reading keywords from course names, course descriptions and keywords added by the educators we remove common words, which are stored in a blacklist, such as &amp;ldquo;a,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;an,&amp;rdquo; etc. (Functionality and blacklist sourced from beliefmedia.com). SmartLibrary constructs SQL queries from the extracted keywords to read material names and links associated with the keywords from the database.
Crawler: We built a crawler which can extract learning material names and keywords from the HTML code of websites such as Coursera.</description>

      <description>Communication Wifi To ensure that our hardware can communicate smoothly in the same network, we use a Raspberry Pi as a WLAN hotspot. This ensures an uninterrupted connection and enables our devices to work together optimally.
MQTT Communication takes place via MQTT, an open network protocol for machine-to-machine communication. The Arduino uses the MQTT protocol to send messages to the Raspberry Pi, which acts as an MQTT broker. At the same time, the HoloLens glasses subscribe to these messages to receive real-time information.</description>

      <description>Organization The project began with a kick-off meeting in which the basic project idea was explained and requirements defined. We also immediately set weekly meeting times that fit into everyone&amp;rsquo;s schedule. In the weeks that followed, we collected ideas for implementation and entered them as issues in our issue tracker, set up the individual parts of the project and started implementing solutions. In the weekly meetings, we informed each other about the project status and discussed our next steps.</description>

      <description>Integrating Meta SDKs with Unity Integrating the Meta XR All-in-One SDK from Oculus presents its own set of challenges. The setup process for this package is complex and sometimes inconsistent. Developers are required to adhere to a strict implementation with limited flexibility for customization.
Additionally, the SDK tends to generate an abundance of debug messages in the console, which are often unnecessary and can obscure more critical information. Another hurdle is the SDK&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;black box&amp;rdquo; backend, which can lead to mysterious errors without a clear source or solution.</description>

      <description>Challenges: User Management: Balancing Complexity and Simplicity The intricacies of managing users across three categoriesâ€”therapists, patients, and parentsâ€”demanded a delicate balance. Based on therapists&amp;rsquo; recommendations, we opted to allow patients and parents to share the same account, simplifying the user experience. However, creating a secure yet straightforward connection between therapists and patients posed a unique challenge. To streamline this, we implemented connection codes, enabling therapists to effortlessly initiate and secure connections with their patients during the first therapy session.</description>

      <description>The VR Testing Environment One goal of our project was to construct a virtual test environment where the interaction between a user and the instructor could be examined. The challenge consisted of creating such an environment while not making it distracting enough to turn the focus away from the character that has to be evaluated. For a majority of our testers this was the first time experiencing a surrounding in Virtual Reality Scene 1 Introduction inside the Apartment In this scene the player is greeted by the instructor, and asked to point out some different uses of electric current in a regular household.</description>

      <description>As we reflect on our current achievements, we envision a future where our web application evolves into an essential tool for diverse forms of mental therapy. Here are key areas where we see potential for improvement: Therapy Session Calendar Streamlining Appointment Management
To streamline the therapeutic process, we plan to incorporate a comprehensive Therapy Session Calendar. This feature would empower therapists and clients to create or request new appointments directly within the app.</description>

      <description>The Oculus Headsets Thanks to the &amp;ldquo;Institut fÃ¼r Kultur und Informatik an der HTW Berlin&amp;rdquo;, which provided us with access to cutting-edge Oculus Headsets. The Quest 2 and Quest Pro, equipped with hand sensors, offered a seamless tracking experience, eliminating the need for external scanning setups. While these headsets proved to be revolutionary, navigating through app testing during the development phase presented its own set of challenges.
Oculus Quest App Meta Developer Hub Building the VR Environment Due to the implementation of the OpenXR Library into the Game Engine Unity, we were able to develop an app that is able to be played on most of the VR Headsets available.</description>
