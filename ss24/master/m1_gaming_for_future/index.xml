      <description>Initial Meetings The three of us, who had worked on the simulation last semester, provided the new team members with a brief introduction to the codebase and detailed information about water scarcity, our algorithms, and other essential aspects. Communication and Iteration We maintained ongoing communication with product owners each week to iterate on and refine project details. Programming We primarily programmed in Unity, engaging in weekly discussions with product owners and regular team meetings to set goals for the upcoming week.</description>
