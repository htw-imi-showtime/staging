      <description>Initial Planning &amp;amp; Feature Scope We started the project with a collaborative brainstorming session to decide what types of audience interaction we wanted to support — including live Q&amp;amp;A, multiple types of polls, wordClouds, and anonymous participation. From there, we drafted basic user stories to shape the initial functionality and guide our development process. This gave us a shared understanding of our goals and helped prioritize what to build first.</description>

      <description> Team Unser komplettes Team trifft sich zwei mal wöchentlich um zu besprechen, was für alle von Bedeutung ist. Wer gerade an ähnlichen Sachen arbeitet, stimmt sich zusätzlich ab. Darüber hinaus sprechen wir Verzögerungen, Probleme und Meinungsverschiedenheiten an, wenn sie entstehen. Wir halten in GitLab Issues fest, woran wir arbeiten und schauen einander in Code Reviews über die Schulter.&#xA;Alejandro Martinez Hernandez Alexander Jäger Anton Lehmann Harvey Benn Konstantin Schiwarov Lennart Weissenstein Tobias Bayer </description>

      <description>Features World The world is made up of a grid of tiles, with each tile representing the area currently visible to the player. The environment consists of low-poly PS1-style assets designed to evoke feelings of eerieness. A thick mist creates feelings of both disorientation and curiosity. As the player moves from one tile to another, the world expands to offer more game features and a wider range of experiences.</description>

      <description>Process Idea On the day of IMI project presentations, Prof. Dr. Lucy Weggler introduced the concept of Gradient Escape to the students. The main focus was to explain gradient functions in a motivating way through a fun game designed for bachelor engineering students. In the initial meeting, the main concept was developed during a brainstorming phase, laying the groundwork for the project. Prof. Dr. Lucy Weggler, a passionate mathematics professor at htw ensured that the educational objectives were met.</description>

      <description>Development Process Our project followed an agile development approach. We utilized GitHub Projects to implement a Kanban board, which allowed us to organize our work into, manageable tickets. Each ticket represented a specific task or feature. The Board consisted of the stages &amp;ldquo;To Do&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;In Progress&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Done,&amp;rdquo; providing us with a good overview of the projects progress. Additionally, we also made a &amp;ldquo;Nice To Have&amp;rdquo; stage for potential new features.</description>

      <description>Process Starting B3 - Berliner Feuerwehr: Helm Sucht Kopf, we began by analyzing the current fire department website to pinpoint its pain points and areas for improvement. Our key questions were: What’s not working? What could be improved? And how can we create solutions that meet the needs of users, stakeholders, and us?&#xA;To better understand user behavior, we examined website statistics provided by the fire department, such as time spent on various pages and points of disengagement.</description>

      <description>Background &amp;amp; Starting Point This project builds on the insights we gained in the ‘Didactics of Media’ course with Prof. Weber-Wulff last semester. In that course, we explored different ways of conveying knowledge to learners. We also examined what learning actually means and how many different approaches there are to understanding a subject.&#xA;At the end of the semester, we worked in small groups to design e-learning unit concepts based on selected topics from the Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s course Informatics 1.</description>

      <description>Process The concept of the game was developed collaboratively during the early stages of the project. We had lengthy discussions about how to design a game that would be both highly engaging and fun. Our idea was to create the perfect mix of “Cooking Mama 2” and “Subway Surfers”, but set entirely in space. While the idea of combining cooking and space initially felt ambitious and even overwhelming at times, we remained committed to our vision.</description>

      <description>Conceptualization &amp;amp; Design The project began with brainstorming sessions, where we explored various ideas, including NPC-based games and AI assistants. After gathering insights from online resources and real-world applications, we decided to merge AI with an immersive travel experience. In the Requirement Analysis phase, we defined the user needs and project goals, ensuring that the platform would offer personalized travel recommendations and seamless interaction. Moving to Design and Prototyping, we created system architecture and UI designs that would provide users with a smooth and intuitive experience.</description>

      <description>Overview Moodle System Architecture Plugins must follow Moodle’s technical and organisational guidelines to qualify for the official plugin directory. Moodle consists of its core with different subsystems and a substantial amount of plugins. These plugins need to be of a specific type. For our plugins these are quiz report and question behaviour. A clear type assignment is essential, because only plugins with an unambiguous type can be correctly installed or published.</description>

      <description>Moodle&amp;#39;s Documentation In the early stages of the project we found that Moodle’s official plugin documentation was incomplete and occasionally outdated. This issue complicated our analysis of the platform architecture and the placement of our own plugins. We therefore had to take a look at existing plugins and figure out the structure ourselves. Due to challenges encountered with the documentation, a non-standard plugin was found that delivered some of the intended features later in the project.</description>

      <description>Research As the very first step of our research, we read studies and articles about the topics of motivation in sports and the effects of audiovisual stimuli on performance to get a better understanding of the field. In regular meetings, we discussed the findings with our partner from the Institute of Sports Science at the University of Bern. We even had the opportunity to try out the spiroergometry test ourselves at a local doctor&amp;rsquo;s office here in Berlin, which was extremely useful in helping us understand the challenges and the importance of motivation during the test.</description>

      <description>Concept &amp;amp; Design Miro was used for the initial brainstorming sessions, for finalizing the requirements and the concept. We used it as well for the first low-fidelity prototypes. It allowed the team to discuss and visualize ideas and record decisions. Figma was used to create the UI component library, style guide, and final design for the user interface of the application.

      <description>General Teachers can choose to enable student reviews for their tests. Installing the plugins does not mean they will be used for every test. Teachers can turn the feature on and off for each test they create. If this feature is activated, students will be asked to rate the difficulty of questions. Once a question in a test has been rated by the student, it won’t be eligible for review anymore.</description>

      <description>Starting Point The project was designed to be used in the upcoming semester by our supervisor Prof. Dr. Lucy Weggler. The creation of this plugin was based on her lacking a reliable difficulty label for her large number of math test questions. To generate difficulty labels before this project, she developed a pipeline that extracts key concepts from math questions using a language model, based on the assumption that more concepts indicate higher difficulty.</description>
