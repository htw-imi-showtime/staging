      <description>Initial Planning &amp;amp; Feature Scope We started the project with a collaborative brainstorming session to decide what types of audience interaction we wanted to support — including live Q&amp;amp;A, multiple types of polls, wordClouds, and anonymous participation. From there, we drafted basic user stories to shape the initial functionality and guide our development process. This gave us a shared understanding of our goals and helped prioritize what to build first.</description>

      <description>Process Starting B3 - Berliner Feuerwehr: Helm Sucht Kopf, we began by analyzing the current fire department website to pinpoint its pain points and areas for improvement. Our key questions were: What’s not working? What could be improved? And how can we create solutions that meet the needs of users, stakeholders, and us?&#xA;To better understand user behavior, we examined website statistics provided by the fire department, such as time spent on various pages and points of disengagement.</description>

      <description>General This e-learning unit is designed for first-semester international students of the Media Informatics Bachelor’s program at HTW Berlin. It teaches the fundamentals of Java programming in a creative and engaging way. Instead of traditional, dry exercises, students are guided through a magical storyline where programming concepts are explained using potions, magical capes, wands, and other fantasy elements. To ensure long-term usability, all learning content is managed via a connected headless CMS, allowing professors and students to adapt and expand the platform beyond the semester.</description>

      <description>Immersive Cycling Experience ErgoScape immerses participants in a virtual cycling experience. The application uses first-person cycling videos while adjusting the playing speed based on the live data from the spiroergometry test and enriching the experience with additional visual effects and motivational elements like progress bars and verbal encouragement. Immersive Cycling Experience Live Data Integration During the spiroergometry test, a lot of medical data, such as heart rate, oxygen consumption, and carbon dioxide production, is collected by the MetaSoft Studio software.</description>

      <description>A WIP image of the game&amp;#39;s UI. Goals and Achievements Our goal for Civitas was the simulation of growing civilisations via player input in a god game setting. The effective utilisation of the created world maps by Genesis has been essential to achieve this goal.&#xA;First steps in a new world&#xA;A big part of our game is the civilisation AI and its movement on the given map. Evaluating the data in a radius around them, each civilisation is locating the most advantageous settling position before trying to survive in this new world.</description>

      <description>A WIP image of the generated map. Goals and Achievements Our primary goal for genesis was to create a procedural generation where each processing step is more and more dependent on the previous ones. We wanted to simulate earth&amp;rsquo;s creation, from the forming of tectonic plates and their movement to the influence of ocean currents on the climate and forming of rivers, forests and herds. We wanted to use as little randomness as possible and try to emulate real geological and meteorological processes.</description>

      <description>Background &amp;amp; Starting Point This project builds on the insights we gained in the ‘Didactics of Media’ course with Prof. Weber-Wulff last semester. In that course, we explored different ways of conveying knowledge to learners. We also examined what learning actually means and how many different approaches there are to understanding a subject.&#xA;At the end of the semester, we worked in small groups to design e-learning unit concepts based on selected topics from the Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s course Informatics 1.</description>

      <description>Process The concept of the game was developed collaboratively during the early stages of the project. We had lengthy discussions about how to design a game that would be both highly engaging and fun. Our idea was to create the perfect mix of “Cooking Mama 2” and “Subway Surfers”, but set entirely in space. While the idea of combining cooking and space initially felt ambitious and even overwhelming at times, we remained committed to our vision.</description>

      <description>Conceptualization &amp;amp; Design The project began with brainstorming sessions, where we explored various ideas, including NPC-based games and AI assistants. After gathering insights from online resources and real-world applications, we decided to merge AI with an immersive travel experience. In the Requirement Analysis phase, we defined the user needs and project goals, ensuring that the platform would offer personalized travel recommendations and seamless interaction. Moving to Design and Prototyping, we created system architecture and UI designs that would provide users with a smooth and intuitive experience.</description>

      <description>Research As the very first step of our research, we read studies and articles about the topics of motivation in sports and the effects of audiovisual stimuli on performance to get a better understanding of the field. In regular meetings, we discussed the findings with our partner from the Institute of Sports Science at the University of Bern. We even had the opportunity to try out the spiroergometry test ourselves at a local doctor&amp;rsquo;s office here in Berlin, which was extremely useful in helping us understand the challenges and the importance of motivation during the test.</description>

      <description>Concept &amp;amp; Design Miro was used for the initial brainstorming sessions, for concretizing the requirements and concept. We used it as well for the first low-fidelity prototypes. It allowed the team to discuss and visualize ideas and record decisions. Figma was used to create the UI component library, style guide and final design for the user interface of the application.
