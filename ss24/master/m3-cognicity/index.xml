      <description>Research As the very first step of our research, we read studies and articles on the topic of cognitive skills and how they can be tested to get an idea of what cognitive skills there are and how they could be measured. We also performed a market analysis to see what existing games with a similar focus are out there and what we could learn from them. Simultaneously, we already collected ideas for possible minigames we could implement to help enhance specific cognitive skills and researched possibilities to motivate our users to keep training.</description>
