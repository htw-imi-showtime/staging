    <div class="content">
        <p>The concept of the game was developed collaboratively during the early stages of the project. We had lengthy discussions about how to design a game that would be both highly engaging and fun. Our idea was to create the perfect mix of “Cooking Mama 2” and “Subway Surfers”, but set entirely in space. While the idea of combining cooking and space initially felt ambitious and even overwhelming at times, we remained committed to our vision.</p>
<p>By breaking the development process into two distinct stages — Endless Runner and Cooking — we were able to stay focused and organized while bringing this unique concept to life. We divided the work into two groups: the programming team focused on implementing the Endless Runner and Cooking mechanics, while the visuals team was tasked with designing cinematic scenes, including a space scene, a Mars scene, and a kitchen scene.</p>
<p>The Endless Runner phase introduced dynamic and engaging gameplay features. Players would need to catch ingredients floating through space while skillfully dodging obstacles like asteroids, which could damage the player’s progress. This element added a layer of excitement and challenge, creating fast-paced gameplay that kept players on their toes.
On the other hand, implementing the cooking process required creativity and experimentation as we worked to design an intuitive yet enjoyable system. We played with a variety of ingredients and recipes, ensuring that players would feel both accomplished and delighted when successfully crafting a dish in the cooking pot.</p>
<p>We constantly provided each other with feedback on the work, whether it was about an odd-looking space station, unappealing planet colors, or ingredients that floated too slowly. This collaborative effort ensured that our game was finely tuned for players to enjoy an immersive experience and engage with the world we created for them.</p>
