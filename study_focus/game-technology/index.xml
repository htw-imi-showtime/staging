      <description>Dive into a journey with our infinite zoom 3D game. Navigate through obstacles, explore funky scenes and test your reflexes in a game that never ends. Each scene brings new thrills, pushing your skills to the limit in a universe that continuously evolves.&#xA;Our Goal The main task of this project was to create a constant zoom effect in a 3D environment that evolves with time and never stops. We wanted to make this experience more engaging for the audience, so we implemented a game mode where the users must avoid the obstacles that come in their way.</description>

      <description>The Problem How good our cognitive abilities are has a significant impact on how good we perceive our own life quality.1&#xA;Unfortunately some health conditions and their treatments can lead to a decline in these abilities. For example, imagine a teenager who has to spend a lot of time in the hospital due to a chronic illness and is unable to attend school regularly. Or a young adult who suffers from a heart disease and has to take regular medication which can affect their cognitive abilities.</description>

      <description>Our Goal This project is about science and how you can save the world. How, you ask? Imagine a scenario where the area available for food production is decreasing. You are part of a team responsible for the indoor cultivation of algae. Those can be used to produce food. Your task is to optimise the production for these algae and feed your country. Take a deep dive in the sience of algae and the related production process.</description>
